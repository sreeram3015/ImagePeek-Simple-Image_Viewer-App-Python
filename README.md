# ImagePeek - Simple Image Viewer App

ImagePeek is a simple image viewer application built using Python and Tkinter. It allows users to open a directory and browse through image files (.png, .jpg, .jpeg) as thumbnail images. When a thumbnail is clicked, the corresponding main image is displayed, providing a quick and easy way to view images.

## Features
- Browse and view image files from a selected directory.
- Display thumbnail images for easy navigation.
- Click on a thumbnail to view the corresponding main image.
- User-friendly interface with a black theme for a pleasant viewing experience.
